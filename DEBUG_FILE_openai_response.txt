The input requires updating and creating content specifically for several tables: capital_expenses, comparable_companies, cost_of_sales, employees, historical_financials, operating_expenses, and revenue. The provided PDF provides some market research insights relevant to the retail sports goods industry, which can be used to infer typical entries for these tables. However, no explicit data is provided within the PDF for these specific tables. Thus, the JSON response will include inferred entries for each of the specified tables based on typical business patterns associated with a sports goods store. All source fields will be marked as "-No Source-" due to the lack of specific data in the PDF.

### SUMMARY START ###
There is a need to update business model tables for capital expenses, comparable companies, and other financial metrics for a sports goods retail business. The input PDF discusses the market situation of the sector without specific financial data or transactions. Therefore, projections and typical entries inferred from general industry practices have been created for the specified tables, with all entries marked as "-No Source-" due to lack of detailed data from the document. The company's operations are inferred to involve both online and offline sales, leading to the creation of pseudonymous data entries for the aforementioned tables.
