The input PDF provides a comprehensive business overview of a full-service heavy/civil contractor, highlighting financial performance, organizational structure, customer base, and industry opportunities. For the task, the relevant tables to update are related to comparable companies, employees, operating expenses, historical financials, capital expenditures, cost of sales, and revenue. Crucial information for these tables, however, specific entries aren't directly provided in the PDF so will be inferred. Each table will include at least five entries to ensure a thorough representation, with detailed notes justifying the assumptions.

Missing data specifics include:
1. Direct comparable companies details.
2. Specific operating cost entries.
3. Fully detailed employee roles and wages beyond highlights.
4. Exact CAPEX, cost of sales, and revenue breakdown outside provided broad categories.

The forthcoming JSON will reflect these inferred datasets.

### SUMMARY START ###
The task involves building financial data tables for a heavy/civic contractor, focusing on comparable companies, employees, operating expenses, historical financials, capital expenditures, cost of sales, and revenue. The PDF outlines organizational aspects, revenue streams, employee details, and financial highlights, which are used to create structured JSON data. Specific entries for these categories were not provided in the document, but inferred from a standard industry perspective, with a blend of assumption and PDF-derived facts.
