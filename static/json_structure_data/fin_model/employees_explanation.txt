Structure Explanation:

The employees table stores employee information and wages. The data must be structured exactly as follows to match the system configuration:


Structure:
- employees (Array): Contains employee role entries with the following required fields:
  - role (String): Job title or role, 1-100 characters
  - number (Number): Number of employees in this role (minimum 0)
  - wage (Number): Wage amount in dollars (minimum 0)
  - wage_type (String): Must be either "hourly" or "salary" 
  - monthly_hours (Number): Expected work hours per month (minimum 0)
  - notes (String): These notes should be to justify the chosen value for role, wage, quantity, or monthly hours. Don't describe the role further.
  - source_link (String): URL to wage/role source information. This is optional. If the source was part of this api call, or is not  a website, leave this blank.
  - source_string (String): Description of wage/role source. This is not optional. If you don't have a source, write "No source"

You may add employees you believe are relevant to the business, even if they aren't found in any sources. However, you must provide a source_string that says "No source".
Please structure this file exactly the same way as the one sent. Root Key: "employees" (This exact root key must be used)
