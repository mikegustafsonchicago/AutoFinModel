Packages: Each key in the JSON file represents a package (sales item), which includes:
name: The name of the package.
price: The total price charged for the package.
price_notes: Notes explaining the price.
ingredients: A list of components that make up the package. Each ingredient has:
ingredient_id: Unique identifier.
ingredient_name: The name of the ingredient.
amount: The quantity used.
unit: The unit of measurement (e.g., box, GB).
price: The price per unit.
notes: Additional details about the ingredient.
processing_list: A list of processes involved in delivering the package.

Packages DO NOT need to have multiple ingredients. This format is setup so that each package contributes to revenue through "price" and COGS through the ingredient prices.
