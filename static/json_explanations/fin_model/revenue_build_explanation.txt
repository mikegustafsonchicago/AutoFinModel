The revenue_build.json file contains a list of revenue sources that contribute to the company's total revenue. Each revenue source has the following structure:

revenue_source_name (String): The name of the revenue stream or service being offered.
revenue_source_price (Number): The price charged per unit/service.
price_source (String): Source of the pricing information.
price_source_link (String): URL link to the source of pricing data.
monthly_transactions (Number): Number of transactions expected per month.
frequency_notes (String): Additional context about transaction frequency.
frequency_source (String): Source of the transaction frequency data.
frequency_source_link (String): URL link to the source of frequency data.

Each revenue source must include all of these required fields to properly document and justify both the pricing and expected transaction volume. The monthly_transactions field must be a positive number, and all source links must be valid URLs.
