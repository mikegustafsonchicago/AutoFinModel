Investment Team Table Explanation

The Investment Team table details the key members of a private equity firm's investment team, including their roles, experience, and background.

Expected JSON Structure:

The data must be returned as a flat list of team members. Each member is represented as an object with the following fields:

investment_team_member_name (String): Full name of the team member.
investment_team_member_title (String): Their title or role within the firm.
investment_team_member_join_date (Integer): Year the team member joined the firm. If unknown, this can be null.
source_string (String): Title or summary of the information source.
source_link (String): URL linking to the source document.

Do not nest the data under a key like "members" or "team". The output must be a direct list of objects.
