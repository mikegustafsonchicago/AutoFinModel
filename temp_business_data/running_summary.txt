The project involves updating several tables for Pay-Ease, a company offering transaction kiosks. Tables to be updated include revenue, ingredients, capex, opex, employees, comparables, and historical financials. Pay-Ease's model handles kiosk-based payments for underbanked or cash-preference consumers, focusing on high foot-traffic locations. Financial data indicates potential growth with increasing kiosks and merchant partnerships in Chicago and beyond.
